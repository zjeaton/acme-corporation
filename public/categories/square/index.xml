Other operations falling into miscellaneous categories include shaping, planing, boring, broaching and sawing.[5]
Turning operations are operations that rotate the workpiece as the primary method of moving metal against the cutting tool. Lathes are the principal machine tool used in turning. Milling operations are operations in which the cutting tool rotates to bring cutting edges to bear against the workpiece.</description></item></channel></rss>
