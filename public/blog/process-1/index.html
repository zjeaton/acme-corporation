Exactly what the &ldquo;controlled&rdquo; part of the definition implies can vary, but it almost always implies the use of machine tools (in addition to just power tools and hand tools).</p><p>Machining is a part of the manufacture of many metal products, but it can also be used on materials such as wood, plastic, ceramic, and composites.[2] A person who specializes in machining is called a machinist. A room, building, or company where machining is done is called a machine shop. Much of modern-day machining is carried out by computer numerical control (CNC), in which computers are used to control the movement and operation of the mills, lathes, and other cutting machines.</p><p>The precise meaning of the term machining has evolved over the past one and a half centuries as technology has advanced. In the 18th century, the word machinist simply meant a person who built or repaired machines. This person&rsquo;s work was done mostly by hand, using processes such as the carving of wood and the hand-forging and hand-filing of metal. At the time, millwrights and builders of new kinds of engines (meaning, more or less, machines of any kind), such as James Watt or John Wilkinson, would fit the definition. The noun machine tool and the verb to machine (machined, machining) did not yet exist.</p><p>Around the middle of the 19th century, the latter words were coined as the concepts that they described evolved into widespread existence. Therefore, during the Machine Age, machining referred to (what we today might call) the &ldquo;traditional&rdquo; machining processes, such as turning, boring, drilling, milling, broaching, sawing, shaping, planing, reaming, and tapping.[3] In these &ldquo;traditional&rdquo; or &ldquo;conventional&rdquo; machining processes, machine tools, such as lathes, milling machines, drill presses, or others, are used with a sharp cutting tool to remove material to achieve a desired geometry.[4]</p><p>Since the advent of new technologies in the post–World War II era, such as electrical discharge machining, electrochemical machining, electron beam machining, photochemical machining, and ultrasonic machining, the retronym &ldquo;conventional machining&rdquo; can be used to differentiate those classic technologies from the newer ones. In current usage, the term &ldquo;machining&rdquo; without qualification usually implies the traditional machining processes.</p><p>In the decades of the 2000s and 2010s, as additive manufacturing (AM) evolved beyond its earlier laboratory and rapid prototyping contexts and began to become common throughout all phases of manufacturing, the term subtractive manufacturing became common retronymously in logical contrast with AM, covering essentially any removal processes also previously covered by the term machining. The two terms are effectively synonymous, although the long-established usage of the term machining continues. This is comparable to the idea that the verb sense of contact evolved because of the proliferation of ways to contact someone (telephone, email, IM, SMS, and so on) but did not entirely replace the earlier terms such as call, talk to, or write to.</p><p>Content from <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machining>wikipedia</a>.</p><div class=tags><a href=/tags/manufacturing><svg width="20" class="icon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 32 32"><path fill="currentcolor" d="M16 5l-.3125.28125L4.28125 16.8125l-.6875.6875.6875.71875 9.5 9.5.71875.6875.6875-.6875L26.71875 16.3125 27 16v-.40625V6 5H26 16.40625 16zm.84375 2H25v8.15625L14.5 25.59375 6.40625 17.5 16.84375 7zM22 9C21.447715 9 21 9.4477153 21 10 21 10.552285 21.447715 11 22 11S23 10.552285 23 10C23 9.4477153 22.552285 9 22 9z"/></svg>Manufacturing</a></div></article></section><footer><div class="items-4 items"><section><h2>About</h2><p>Acme Corporation is the world&rsquo;s leading manufacturer of digital shapes.
